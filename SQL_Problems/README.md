-> This is SQL Section and I have tried to solve all the problems of the book - 
   "SQL Practice Problems" By Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.

-> It has 3 sections viz. Beginner, Intermediate and advanced

-> Beginner section spans for problem 1-19
   Intermediate section spans for problem 20-31
   Advanced section spans for problem 32-57

-> All questions are based on fairly standard "NorthWind" database.

-> Book specified no specific tool for solving so I have used Microsoft 
   SQL Server for creating scripts.

-> If you get access to the book, you'll notice that the problems are given 
   with hints and later solutions as well.

-> Here I have tried some of the intermediate and advanced problems in a
   different way than the given solutins and hints.
